## Question 1: Profit Estimation

One of the crucial questions in the analysis and evaluation of various companies is estimating profits. Predicting future events and making informed decisions for company strategies are among the key applications of profit estimation.

In this section, our goal is to train a model that can calculate the profit of a sold product using the provided dataset. We need to preprocess the data, select suitable features, and design a model capable of predicting the "profit" column based on all available features. It is important to ensure that our model is generalizable and does not suffer from overfitting issues.

## Question 2: Shipping Mode Prediction

Shipping methods play a significant role in the profitability of online sales companies. These companies often offer special services to customers who are willing to pay more for faster delivery. Our task is to predict the likely shipping mode associated with each order using the provided dataset.

To accomplish this, we will preprocess the data, select relevant features, and train a model capable of predicting the "Ship Mode" for each order based on all available features. The objective is to enable the company to offer targeted discounts on different shipping options, encouraging customers to choose more expensive services. This will enhance the shipping model by providing customers with an improved experience.
